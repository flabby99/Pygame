# Pygame
Some short test scripts I made to test the basics of pygame

# Running
Most of these scripts only require pygame - use pip install pygame as one example to get this package

# Explanation
In general I was just testing basic primitives and how to render and move them. Sample Game contains something a bit terrifying and I have no idea what I was thinking
